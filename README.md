# state-machine

Simple state machine implementation.
Supports defining events, states, actions and transitions, as well as saving the current state and starting a new machine from the saved state.

There is a main file in ThreeMachine.java with some tests on a machine that counts 3 events of the same type.
I didn't add a proper testing framework just to keep things simple.
